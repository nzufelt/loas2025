### Car Insurance

Create some Python code that effectively determines what someoneâ€™s car insurance premium should be based on some data that it collects from the user (via `input`). The number should be realistic and the reasons behind the decisions (made using `if` statements) should be ethically sound. 
You should add comments to each of your decision points describing why you think that the points are ethically sound. 
Use a `while` loop to check for valid inputs.
