## A curated list of resources
I've tried to be as thorough and accurate as possible above, but some of these resources are likely less useful than others. In this list, I pull what I think might be the most useful from among the above, and list use cases as relevant.

* [Co-Intelligence](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741805/co-intelligence-by-ethan-mollick/) by Ethan Mollick. This book is for laypeople to understand generative AI, with an eye toward how to extract the most value from your interactions with AI. It's where useful advice like "Invite AI to the Table" comes from. I think it's definitely worth a read, but just keep a critical eye out using Nick's "Slow AI" approach.
* [Learning in the brain](https://sites.google.com/view/efratfurst/teaching-with-learning-in-mind/learning-in-the-brain) by Efrat Furst. This is a wonderful resource to learn more about the human brain and how it learns. If you are someone who learns, and wants that to be a significant part of your identity, then this is worth a read.
* [Confessions of a Virtual Writer](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-viral-ai-writer-chatgpt/) and the corresponding [Ghosts](https://www.thebeliever.net/ghosts/) by Vauhini Vara. These together tell a story about how the author couldn't create the narrative surrounding the loss of her sister, and how AI helped her do so. It's a fascinating lens through which to view the provocation, "Don't let AI steal your voice."
* [Reading and Writing](https://newsletter.dancohen.org/archive/reading-and-writing/) by Dan Cohen. This is a short read, but it motivates a lot of how I view the "Slow AI" approach.
* [Neural Networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks) By Grant Sanderson / 3 Blue 1 Brown. Use this resource to go _way_ deeper on what is a neural network, and in particular, what is generative AI. Lots of math here, but also lots of beautiful visuals.
